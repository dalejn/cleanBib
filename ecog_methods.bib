abstract = {Twenty years ago, a link was discovered between the neurotransmitter dopamine and 11 the computational framework of reinforcement learning. Since then, it has become well 12 established that dopamine release reflects a reward prediction error, a surprise signal that 13 drives learning of reward predictions and shapes future behavior. According to the now 14 canonical theory, reward predictions are represented as a single scalar quantity, which 15 supports learning about the expectation, or mean, of stochastic outcomes. In the present 16 work, we propose a novel account of dopamine-based reinforcement learning, reporting 17 experimental results which point to a significant modification of the standard reward 18 prediction error theory. Inspired by recent artificial intelligence research on distributional 19 reinforcement learning, we hypothesized that the brain represents possible future rewards 20 not as a single mean, but instead as a probability distribution, effectively representing 21 multiple future outcomes simultaneously and in parallel. This idea leads immediately to 22 a set of empirical predictions, which we tested using single-unit recordings from mouse 23 ventral tegmental area. Our findings provide strong evidence for a neural realization of 24},

abstract = {Neuroimaging evidence suggests that the default mode network (DMN) exhibits antagonistic activity with dorsal attention (DAN) and salience (SN) networks. Here we use human intracranial electroencephalography to investigate the behavioral relevance of fine-grained dynamics within and between these networks. The three networks show dissociable profiles of task-evoked electrophysiological activity, best captured in the high-frequency broadband (HFB; 70-170 Hz) range. On the order of hundreds of milliseconds, HFB responses peak fastest in the DAN, at intermediate speed in the SN, and slowest in the DMN. Lapses of attention (behavioral errors) are marked by distinguishable patterns of both pre-and post-stimulus HFB activity within each network. Moreover, the magnitude of temporally lagged, negative HFB coupling between the DAN and DMN (but not SN and DMN) is associated with greater sustained attention performance and is reduced during wakeful rest. These findings underscore the behavioral relevance of temporally delayed coordination between antagonistic brain networks.},

Yet, metabolic and information transfer efficiency across structural networks are not understood. In a large cohort of youth, we find metabolic costs associated with structural path strengths supporting information diffusion. Metabolism is balanced with the coupling of structures supporting diffusion and network modularity. To understand efficient network communication, we develop a theory specifying minimum rates of message diffusion that brain regions should transmit for an expected fidelity, and we test five predictions from the theory. We introduce compression efficiency, which quantifies differing trade-offs between lossy compression and communication fidelity in structural networks. Compression efficiency evolves with development, heightens when metabolic gradients guide diffusion, constrains network complexity, explains how rich-club hubs integrate information, and correlates with cortical areal scaling, myelination, and speed-accuracy trade-offs. Our findings elucidate how network structures and metabolic resources support efficient neural communication.},

abstract = {Human intracranial EEG (iEEG) recordings are primarily performed in epileptic patients for presurgical mapping. When patients perform cognitive tasks, iEEG signals reveal high-frequency neural activities (HFAs, between around 40. Hz and 150. Hz) with exquisite anatomical, functional and temporal specificity. Such HFAs were originally interpreted in the context of perceptual or motor binding, in line with animal studies on gamma-band ('40. Hz') neural synchronization. Today, our understanding of HFA has evolved into a more general index of cortical processing: task-induced HFA reveals, with excellent spatial and time resolution, the participation of local neural ensembles in the task-at-hand, and perhaps the neural communication mechanisms allowing them to do so. This review promotes the claim that studying HFA with iEEG provides insights into the neural bases of cognition that cannot be derived as easily from other approaches, such as fMRI. We provide a series of examples supporting that claim, drawn from studies on memory, language and default-mode networks, and successful attempts of real-time functional mapping. These examples are followed by several guidelines for HFA research, intended for new groups interested by this approach. Overall, iEEG research on HFA should play an increasing role in cognitive neuroscience in humans, because it can be explicitly linked to basic research in animals. We conclude by discussing the future evolution of this field, which might expand that role even further, for instance through the use of multi-scale electrodes and the fusion of iEEG with MEG and fMRI. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

Therefore, the ongoing activity ascribed to the different functional brain networks should also be able to reorganise and coordinate via similar mechanisms. We develop a novel method for identifying large-scale phase-coupled network dynamics and show that resting networks in magnetoencephalography are well characterised by visits to short-lived transient brain states, with spatially distinct patterns of oscillatory power and coherence in specific frequency bands. Brain states are identified for sensory, motor networks and higher-order cognitive networks. The cognitive networks include a posterior alpha (8–12 Hz) and an anterior delta/theta range (1–7 Hz) network, both exhibiting high power and coherence in areas that correspond to posterior and anterior subdivisions of the default mode network. Our results show that large-scale cortical phase-coupling networks have characteristic signatures in very specific frequency bands, possibly reflecting functional specialisation at different intrinsic timescales.},

abstract = {In this paper, a brief, preliminary attempt is made to frame a scientific debate about how functional responses at gamma frequencies in electrophysiological recordings (EEG, MEG, ECoG, and LFP) should be classified and interpreted. In general, are all gamma responses the same, or should they be divided into different classes according to criteria such as their spectral characteristics (frequency range and/or shape), their spatial-temporal patterns of occurrence, and/or their responsiveness under different task conditions? In particular, are the responses observed in intracranial EEG at a broad range of "high gamma" frequencies ({\~{}}. 60-200. Hz) different from gamma responses observed at lower frequencies ({\~{}}. 30-80. Hz), typically in narrower bands? And if they are different, how should they be interpreted? Does the broad spectral shape of high gamma responses arise from the summation of many different narrow-band oscillations, or does it reflect something completely different? If we are not sure, should we refer to high gamma activity as oscillations? A variety of theories have posited a mechanistic role for gamma activity in cortical function, often assuming narrow-band oscillations. These theories continue to influence the design of experiments and the interpretation of their results. Do these theories apply to all electrophysiological responses at gamma frequencies? Although no definitive answers to these questions are immediately anticipated, this paper will attempt to review the rationale for why they are worth asking and to point to some of the possible answers that have been proposed. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier B.V.},

During virtual movement, we observed hippocampal oscillations at multiple frequencies from 2 to 10 Hz. The posterior hippocampus prominently displayed oscillations at {\~{}}8 Hz and the precise frequency of these oscillations correlated with the speed of movement, implicating these signals in spatial navigation. We also observed slower 3-Hz oscillations, but these signals were more prevalent in the anterior hippocampus and their frequency did not vary with movement speed.

Most network approaches, however, focus on static representations of the brain's physical or statistical connectivity. Few studies have examined how brain functional networks evolve spontaneously over long epochs of continuous time. To address this, we examine functional connectivity networks deduced from continuous long-term electrocorticogram recordings. For a population of six human patients, we identify a persistent pattern of connections that form a frequency-band-dependent network template, and a set of core connections that appear frequently and together. These structures are robust, emerging from brief time intervals (100 s) regardless of cognitive state. These results suggest that a metastable, frequency-band-dependent scaffold of brain connectivity exists from which transient activity emerges and recedes.},

abstract = {Functional connectivity networks have become a central focus in neuroscience because they reveal key higher-dimensional features of normal and abnormal nervous system physiology. Functional networks reflect activity-based coupling between brain regions that may be constrained by relatively static anatomical connections, yet these networks appear to support tremendously dynamic behaviors. Within this growing field, the stability and temporal characteristics of functional connectivity brain networks have not been well characterized. We evaluated the temporal stability of spontaneous functional connectivity networks derived from multi-day scalp encephalogram (EEG) recordings in five healthy human subjects. Topological stability and graph characteristics of networks derived from averaged data epochs ranging from 1 s to multiple hours across different states of consciousness were compared. We show that, although functional networks are highly variable on the order of seconds, stable network templates emerge after as little as ∼100 s of recording and persist across different states and frequency bands (albeit with slightly different characteristics in different states and frequencies). Within these network templates, the most common edges are markedly consistent, constituting a network "core." Although average network topologies persist across time, measures of global network connectivity, density and clustering coefficient, are state and frequency specific, with sparsest but most highly clustered networks seen during sleep and in the gamma frequency band. These findings support the notion that a core functional organization underlies spontaneous cortical processing and may provide a reference template on which unstable, transient, and rapidly adaptive long-range assemblies are overlaid in a frequency-dependent manner.},

Here, we present a new analysis framework, complementary to Fourier analysis, that quantifies cycle-by-cycle time-domain features. For each cycle, the amplitude, period, and waveform symmetry are measured, the latter of which is missed using conventional approaches. Additionally, oscillatory bursts are algorithmically identified, allowing us to investigate the variability of oscillatory features within and between bursts. This approach is validated on simulated noisy signals with oscillatory bursts and outperforms conventional metrics.

abstract = {Oscillations are a prevalent feature of brain recordings. They are believed to play key roles in neural communication and computation. Current analysis methods for studying neural oscillations often implicitly assume that the oscillations are sinusoidal. While these approaches have proven fruitful, we show here that there are numerous instances in which neural oscillations are nonsinusoidal. We highlight approaches to characterize nonsinusoidal features and account for them in traditional spectral analysis. Instead of being a nuisance, we discuss how these nonsinusoidal features may provide crucial and so far overlooked physiological information related to neural communication, computation, and cognition. Neural Oscillation Characterization Rhythms in neural activity are observed across various temporal and spatial scales and are often referred to as oscillations (see Glossary) [1]. Traditionally, neural oscillations have been clustered into canonical frequency bands, including delta (1-4 Hz), theta (4-8 Hz), alpha (8-12 Hz), beta (15-30 Hz), gamma (30-90 Hz), and high gamma ({\textgreater}50 Hz). These bands roughly correspond to frequency ranges commonly observed in human electroencephalography (EEG) studies. Although they have been observed for nearly a century, recent theories suggest that these oscillations play an active role in neural communication [2]. One prominent theory is that oscillations accomplish this function using cross-frequency coupling (CFC), in which multiple neural oscillators in different frequency ranges interact with one another [3]. To characterize this coupling, the phase and amplitude properties of each oscillator are calculated using spectral analysis. A key feature in all spectral analysis methods is that they inherently assume that the fluctuations in brain activity over time can be characterized using a sinusoidal basis. That is, the underlying assumption is that the complexities of oscillatory brain activity are best captured by sinusoidal oscillators. A sinusoid (or sine wave) is a smoothly varying rhythmic signal governed by a mathematical equation. However, as we will discuss below, neural oscillations are commonly nonsinusoidal. Instead of being a nuisance, we argue that these nonsinusoidal features may contain crucial physiological information about the neural systems and dynamics that generate them. We address here the inconsistency between standard neural analysis approaches and the observed nonsinusoidal shapes of oscillatory waveforms. We begin by reviewing a diverse set of examples of nonsinusoidal oscillations across species. Interestingly, studies published before the modern proliferation of advanced computation have focused more on raw, unfiltered data, by necessity. By contrast, recent studies tend to focus on heavily processed data and lack attention to the oscillatory waveform shapes. We discuss methodological approaches for Trends The properties of neural oscillations are commonly correlated to disease or behavior states. These measures are mostly derived using traditional spectral analysis techniques that assume a sinusoidal basis. Electrical recordings from many brain regions, at multiple spatial scales, exhibit neural oscillations that are nonsinusoidal. New methods have been developed to quantify the nonsinusoidal features of oscillations and account for these features when using traditional spectral analysis. Features of oscillatory waveform shape have been related to physiological processes and behaviors. Manipulating the features of stimulation waveforms changes the effects of rhythmic electrical stimulation.},

One previously proposed solution to this problem is to use a sparse regularized inverse covariance matrix or precision matrix (SRPM) assuming that the connectivity structure is sparse. This method yields partial correlations to measure strong direct interactions between pairs of regions while simultaneously removing the influence of the rest of the regions, thus identifying regions that are conditionally independent. To test our methods, we first demonstrated conditions under which the SRPM method could indeed find the true physical connection between a pair of nodes for a spring-mass example and an RC circuit example. The recovery of the connectivity structure using the SRPM method can be explained by energy models using the Boltzmann distribution. We then demonstrated the application of the SRPM method for estimating brain connectivity during stage 2 sleep spindles from human electrocorticography (ECoG) recordings using an 8 × 8 electrode array. The ECoG recordings that we analyzed were from a 32-year-old male patient with long-standing pharmaco-resistant left temporal lobe complex partial epilepsy. Sleep spindles were automatically detected using delay differential analysis and then analyzed with SRPM and the Louvain method for community detection. We found spatially localized brain networks within and between neighboring cortical areas during spindles, in contrast to the case when sleep spindles were not present.},

Coherence, based on Fourier analysis, has been commonly used as a first approximation to track such coupling under the assumption that neural signals are stationary. Yet, stationary neural processing may be the exception rather than the rule. In this context, the recent application to physical systems of a wavelet-based coherence, which does not depend on the stationarity of the signals, is highly relevant. This paper fully develops the method of wavelet coherence and its statistical properties so that it can be practically applied to continuous neural signals. In realistic simulations, we show that, in contrast to Fourier coherence, wavelet coherence can detect short, significant episodes of coherence between non-stationary neural signals.

Rhythmic neuronal interactions can be quantified using multiple metrics, each with their own advantages and disadvantages. This tutorial will review and summarize current analysis methods used in the field of invasive and non-invasive electrophysiology to study the dynamic connections between neuronal populations. First, we review metrics for functional connectivity, including coherence, phase synchronization, phase-slope index, and Granger causality, with the specific aim to provide an intuition for how these metrics work, as well as their quantitative definition. Next, we highlight a number of interpretational caveats and common pitfalls that can arise when performing functional connectivity analysis, including the common reference problem, the signal to noise ratio problem, the volume conduction problem, the common input problem, and the sample size bias problem. These pitfalls will be illustrated by presenting a set of MATLAB-scripts, which can be executed by the reader to simulate each of these potential problems. We discuss how these issues can be addressed using current methods.},

abstract = {Higher socioeconomic status (SES) in childhood is associated with increased cognitive abilities, higher academic achievement, and decreased incidence of mental illness later in development. Accumulating evidence suggests that these effects may be due to changes in brain development induced by environmental factors. While prior work has mapped the associations between neighborhood SES and brain structure, little is known about the relationship between SES and intrinsic neural dynamics. Here, we capitalize upon a large community-based sample (Philadelphia Neurodevelopmental Cohort, ages 8-22 years, n=1012) to examine developmental changes in functional brain network topology as estimated from resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging data. We quantitatively characterize this topology using a local measure of network segregation known as the clustering coefficient, and find that it accounts for a greater degree of SES-associated variance than meso-scale segregation captured by modularity. While whole-brain clustering increased with age, high-SES youth displayed faster increases in clustering than low-SES youth, and this effect was most pronounced for regions in the limbic, somatomotor, and ventral attention systems. The effect of SES on developmental increases in clustering was strongest for connections of intermediate physical length, consistent with faster decreases in local connectivity in these regions in low-SES youth, and tracked changes in BOLD signal complexity in the form of regional homogeneity. Our findings suggest that neighborhood SES may fundamentally alter intrinsic patterns of inter-regional interactions in the human brain in a manner that is consistent with greater segregation of information processing in late childhood and adolescence.},

abstract = {Electrophysiological signals across species and recording scales exhibit both periodic and aperiodic features. Periodic oscillations have been widely studied and linked to numerous physiological, cognitive, behavioral, and disease states, while the aperiodic "background" 1/f component of neural power spectra has received far less attention. Most analyses of oscillations are conducted on a priori, canonically-defined frequency bands without consideration of the underlying aperiodic structure, or verification that a periodic signal even exists in addition to the aperiodic signal. This is problematic, as recent evidence shows that the aperiodic signal is dynamic, changing with age, task demands, and cognitive state. It has also been linked to the relative excitation/inhibition of the underlying neuronal population. This means that standard analytic approaches easily conflate changes in the periodic and aperiodic signals with one another because the aperiodic parameters--along with oscillation center frequency, power, and bandwidth--are all dynamic in physiologically meaningful, but likely different, ways. In order to overcome the limitations of traditional narrowband analyses and to reduce the potentially deleterious effects of conflating these features, we introduce a novel algorithm for automatic parameterization of neural power spectral densities (PSDs) as a combination of the aperiodic signal and putative periodic oscillations. Notably, this algorithm requires no a priori specification of band limits and accounts for potentially-overlapping oscillations while minimizing the degree to which they are confounded with one another. This algorithm is amenable to large-scale data exploration and analysis, providing researchers with a tool to quickly and accurately parameterize neural power spectra.},

abstract = {It is widely assumed that distributed neuronal networks are fundamental to the functioning of the brain. Consistent spike timing between neurons is thought to be one of the key principles for the formation of these networks. This can involve synchronous spiking or spiking with time delays, forming spike sequences when the order of spiking is consistent. Finding networks defined by their sequence of time-shifted spikes, denoted here as spike timing networks, is a tremendous challenge. As neurons can participate in multiple spike sequences at multiple between-spike time delays, the possible complexity of networks is prohibitively large. We present a novel approach that is capable of (1) extracting spike timing networks regardless of their sequence complexity, and (2) that describes their spiking sequences with high temporal precision. We achieve this by decomposing frequency-transformed neuronal spiking into separate networks, characterizing each network's spike sequence by a time delay per neuron, forming a spike sequence timeline. These networks provide a detailed template for an investigation of the experimental relevance of their spike sequences. Using simulated spike timing networks, we show network extraction is robust to spiking noise, spike timing jitter, and partial occurrences of the involved spike sequences. Using rat multi-neuron recordings, we demonstrate the approach is capable of revealing real spike timing networks with sub-millisecond temporal precision. By uncovering spike timing networks, the prevalence, structure, and function of complex spike sequences can be investigated in greater detail, allowing us to gain a better understanding of their role in neuronal functioning. Significance Statement Spike timing consistencies in neuronal networks are widely thought to be one of several key principles behind neuronal functioning. They are challenging to investigate, however, because there is effectively an infinite number of combinations of neurons and their between-neuron time delays for any given recording. Many techniques have been developed for their analysis, but they are still limited by the complexity of spike timing patterns they can reveal. Here we present a novel approach that can reveal spike timing patterns with arbitrary combinatorial complexity. This provides a new opportunity for investigating spike timing networks, which is crucial to gain a better understanding of the role they play in neuronal functioning.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2018 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved. Network oscillations across and within brain areas are critical for learning and performance of memory tasks. While a large amount of work has focused on the generation of neural oscillations, their effect on neuronal populations' spiking activity and information encoding is less known. Here, we use computational modeling to demonstrate that a shift in resonance responses can interact with oscillating input to ensure that networks of neurons properly encode new information represented in external inputs to the weights of recurrent synaptic connections. Using a neuronal network model, we find that due to an input current-dependent shift in their resonance response, individual neurons in a network will arrange their phases of firing to represent varying strengths of their respective inputs. As networks encode information, neurons fire more synchronously, and this effect limits the extent to which further "learning" (in the form of changes in synaptic strength) can occur. We also demonstrate that sequential patterns of neuronal firing can be accurately stored in the network; these sequences are later reproduced without external input (in the context of subthreshold oscillations) in both the forward and reverse directions (as has been observed following learning in vivo). To test whether a similar mechanism could act in vivo, we show that periodic stimulation of hippocampal neurons coordinates network activity and functional connectivity in a frequencydependent manner. We conclude that resonance with subthreshold oscillations provides a plausible network-level mechanism to accurately encode and retrieve information without overstrengthening connections between neurons.},

abstract = {The human default network (DN) plays a critical role in internally directed cognition, behavior, and neuropsychiatric disease. Despite much progress with functional neuroimaging, persistent questions still linger concerning the electrophysiological underpinnings, fast temporal dynamics, and causal impor-tance of the DN. Here, we review how direct intracranial recording and stimu-lation of the DN provides a unique combination of high spatiotemporal resolution and causal information that speaks directly to many of these out-standing questions. Our synthesis highlights the electrophysiological basis of activation, suppression, and connectivity of the DN, each key areas of debate in the literature. Integrating these unique electrophysiological data with extant neuroimaging findings will help lay the foundation for a mechanistic account of DN function in human behavior and cognition. Toward a Deeper Understanding of the Default Network Serendipity has played an eminent role in the history of scientific discovery: chance observations and insights are alleged to lie at the root of many major and minor break-throughs [1]. Every innovation must subsequently be refined and scrutinized, however; every paradigm shift in scientific thinking must be followed by years or decades of rigorous and painstaking 'normal science' [2]. The fortuitous discovery of the default mode network [or default network (DN), see Glossary] some 20 years ago provides a prototypical example [3–5]: the unexpected observation that a consistent set of brain regions showed reduced cerebral blood flow ('deactivated') during a variety of cognitive tasks (compared to rest [4,5]) seeded a paradigm shift in our view of the functional architecture of the brain [6–8]. The human DN is now well known as a collection of associative brain regions distributed over the temporal, parietal, and frontal lobes (Figure 1), readily identifiable by correlated sponta-neous fluctuations in the fMRI blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) signal. The DN is just one of numerous distributed intrinsic brain networks [9–12] identified during the resting state and persistently correlated during a variety of cognitive tasks [13,14] and states of consciousness [15–17]. Despite much progress with neuroimaging [18], persistent ques-tions still linger concerning the electrophysiological underpinnings, fast temporal dynamics, and causal importance of the human DN. We require a fuller understanding of how this canonical brain network contributes to human cognition and behavior, and how its patho-logical modulation relates to neuropsychiatric disorders. Such an understanding calls for a detailed neuromechanistic account that explains the DN's internal dynamics and interac-tions with other intrinsic networks with high anatomical precision and temporal resolution. Moreover, the relationships between DN activity and human subjective experience and behavior need to be explored with causal methods that go beyond mere correlative observations.},

In contrast, higher-frequency oscillations (250-500 Hz), termed fast ripples (FR), have been described in seizure-generating limbic areas of rodents made epileptic by intrahippocampal injection of kainic acid and observed in humans ipsilateral to areas of seizure initiation. However, quantitative studies supporting the existence of two spectrally distinct oscillatory events have not been carried out in humans nor has the preferential appearance of FR within seizure generating areas received statistical evaluation based on analysis of a large sample of oscillatory events. Interictal oscillations within the bandwidth of 80-500 Hz were detected in Hip and EC areas of patients with mesial temporal lobe epilepsy using wideband EEG recorded during non-rapid eye-movement sleep from chronically implanted depth electrodes. Power spectral analysis showed that oscillations detected from Hip and EC areas were composed of two spectrally distinct groups. The lower-frequency ripple group was defined by a frequency of 96 +/- 14 Hz (median +/- width), while the higher-frequency FR group had a frequency of 262 +/- 59 Hz. FR oscillations were significantly shorter in duration compared with ripple oscillations (P {\textless} 0.0001). In regard to the occurrence of FR and ripples in epileptic Hip and EC, the mean ratio of the number of FR to ripples generated in areas ipsilateral to seizure onset was significantly higher compared with the mean ratio of FR to ripple generation from contralateral areas (P = 0.008). Furthermore, sites ipsilateral to seizure onset with hippocampal atrophy had significantly higher ratios compared with sites contralateral to both seizure onset and hippocampal atrophy (P = 0.001). These data provide compelling quantitative and statistical evidence for the existence of two spectrally distinct groups of limbic oscillations that have frequency and duration characteristics similar to those previously described in epileptic rat and human Hip and EC. The strong association between FR and regions of seizure initiation supports the view that FR reflects pathological hypersynchronous events crucially associated with seizure genesis.},

Another view is that variability of spikes is centrally coordinated and that this brain-generated ensemble pattern in cortical structures is itself a potential source of cognition. Large-scale recordings from neuronal ensembles now offer the opportunity to test these competing theoretical frameworks. Currently, wire and micro-machined silicon electrode arrays can record from large numbers of neurons and monitor local neural circuits at work.

abstract = {Synchronization of neural oscillations as a mechanism of brain function is attracting increas-ing attention. Neural oscillation is a rhythmic neural activity that can be easily observed by noninvasive electroencephalography (EEG). Neural oscillations show the same frequency and cross-frequency synchronization for various cognitive and perceptual functions. How-ever, it is unclear how this neural synchronization is achieved by a dynamical system. If neu-ral oscillations are weakly coupled oscillators, the dynamics of neural synchronization can be described theoretically using a phase oscillator model. We propose an estimation method to identify the phase oscillator model from real data of cross-frequency synchro-nized activities. The proposed method can estimate the coupling function governing the properties of synchronization. Furthermore, we examine the reliability of the proposed method using time-series data obtained from numerical simulation and an electronic circuit experiment, and show that our method can estimate the coupling function correctly. Finally, we estimate the coupling function between EEG oscillation and the speech sound envelope, and discuss the validity of these results. Author summary In this paper, we propose an estimation method to identify a dynamical system from rhythmic time-series data. Rhythmic activities have been observed frequently and are syn-chronized in various fields, and synchronization is an important topic in nonlinear sci-ence. It is well known that such synchronization can be described theoretically by a phase oscillator model under the condition that the rhythmic activities can be considered weakly coupled limit-cycle oscillators. Based on this theory, we propose a method to identify the interaction between rhythmic activities as a network of phase oscillators. A practical advantage of the proposed method is that, without detailed modeling, we can extract the phase oscillator model directly from time-series data. For the above theoretical and practi-cal reasons, this method can be applied to rhythmic data from a wide range of fields. In this study, we have focused on human brain activities in which electroencephalography (EEG) signals are often synchronized with each other and with external periodic stimuli.

Seizure-induced brain damage is not conclusively demonstrated both in humans and in animal models of epilepsy. We evaluated the expression of brain injury biomarkers on post-surgical brain tissue obtained from 20 patients with frequent seizures and a long history of drug-resistant focal epilepsy. Methods The expression patterns of specific glial, neuronal and inflammatory molecules was evaluated by immunohistochemistry in the core of type II focal cortical dysplasias (FCD-II), at the FCD boundary (perilesion) and in the adjacent normal-appearing area included in the epileptogenic region. We also analysed surgical specimens from cryptogenic patients not presenting structural alterations at imaging. Results Astroglial and microglial activation, reduced neuronal density, peri-vascular CD3-positive T lymphocytes clustering and fibrinogen extravasation were demonstrated in the core of FCD-II lesions. No pathological immunoreactivity was observed outside the FCD-II and in cryptogenetic specimens, where the occurrence of interictal and ictal epileptiform activity was confirmed by either stereo-EEG or intraoperative electrocorticography. Interpretation Recurrent seizures do not induce the expression of brain damage markers in non-lesional epileptogenic cortex studied on post-surgical tissue from cryptogenic and FCD patients. This evidence argues against the hypothesis that epileptiform activity per se contributes to focal brain injury, at least in the neocortical epilepsies here considered.},

Even simple sensory, motor and cognitive tasks depend on the precise coordination of many brain areas. Recent improvements in the methods of studying long-range communication have allowed us to address several important questions. What are the common mechanisms that govern local and long-range communication and how do they relate to the structure of the brain? How does oscillatory synchronization subserve neural communication? And what are the consequences of abnormal synchronization?},

Although the major contributor of the extracellular signal is the synaptic transmembrane current, other sources--including Na(+) and Ca(2+) spikes, ionic fluxes through voltage- and ligand-gated channels, and intrinsic membrane oscillations--can substantially shape the extracellular field. High-density recordings of field activity in animals and subdural grid recordings in humans, combined with recently developed data processing tools and computational modelling, can provide insight into the cooperative behaviour of neurons, their average synaptic input and their spiking output, and can increase our understanding of how these processes contribute to the extracellular signal.},

abstract = {Cognitive neuroscience has seen rapid growth in the size and complexity of data recorded from the human brain as well as in the computational tools available to analyze this data. This data explosion has resulted in an increased use of multivariate, model-based methods for asking neuroscience questions, allowing scientists to investigate multiple hypotheses with a single dataset, to use complex, time-varying stimuli, and to study the human brain under more naturalistic conditions. These tools come in the form of "Encoding" models, in which stimulus features are used to model brain activity, and "Decoding" models, in which neural features are used to generated a stimulus output. Here we review the current state of encoding and decoding models in cognitive electrophysiology and provide a practical guide toward conducting experiments and analyses in this emerging field. Our examples focus on using linear models in the study of human language and audition. We show how to calculate auditory receptive fields from natural sounds as well as how to decode neural recordings to predict speech. The paper aims to be a useful tutorial to these approaches, and a practical introduction to using machine learning and applied statistics to build models of neural activity. The data analytic approaches we discuss may also be applied to other sensory modalities, motor systems, and cognitive systems, and we cover some examples in these areas. In addition, a collection of Jupyter notebooks is publicly available as a complement to the material covered in this paper, providing code examples and tutorials for predictive modeling in python. The aim is to provide a practical understanding of predictive modeling of human brain data and to propose best-practices in conducting these analyses.},

@article{Causality2017,
abstract = {When analyzing neural data it is important to consider the limitations of the particular experimental setup. An enduring issue in the context of electrophysiology is the presence of common signals. For example a non-silent reference electrode adds a common signal across all recorded data and this adversely affects functional and effective connectivity analysis. To address the common signals problem, a number of methods have been proposed, but relatively few detailed investigations have been carried out. We address this gap by analyzing local field potentials recorded from the small brains of fruit flies. We conduct our analysis following a solid mathematical framework that allows us to make precise predictions regarding the nature of the common signals. We demonstrate how a framework that jointly analyzes power, coherence and quantities from the Granger causality framework allows us to detect and assess the nature of the common signals. Our analysis revealed substantial common signals in our data, in part due to a non-silent reference electrode. We further show that subtracting spatially adjacent signals (bipolar rereferencing) largely removes the effects of the common signals. However, in some special cases this operation itself introduces a common signal. The mathematical framework and analysis pipeline we present can readily be used by others to detect and assess the nature of the common signals in their data, thereby reducing the chance of misinterpreting the results of functional and effective connectivity analysis.},

@article{DuprelaTour2017,
abstract = {We address the issue of reliably detecting and quantifying cross-frequency coupling (CFC) in neural time series. Based on non-linear auto-regressive models, the proposed method provides a generative and parametric model of the time-varying spectral content of the signals. As this method models the entire spectrum simultaneously, it avoids the pitfalls related to incorrect filtering or the use of the Hilbert transform on wide-band signals. As the model is probabilistic, it also provides a score of the model " goodness of fit " via the likelihood, enabling easy and legitimate model selection and parameter comparison; this data-driven feature is unique to our model-based approach. Using three datasets obtained with invasive electrophysiological recordings in humans and rodents, we demonstrate that these models are able to replicate previous results obtained with other metrics, but also reveal new insights such as the influence of the amplitude of the slow oscillation. Using simulations we demonstrate that our parametric method can reveal neural couplings with shorter signals than non-parametric methods. We also show how the likelihood can be used to find optimal filtering parameters, suggesting new properties on the spectrum of the driving signal, but also to estimate the optimal delay between the coupled signals, enabling a directionality estimation in the coupling. Author Summary Neural oscillations synchronize information across brain areas at various anatomical and temporal scales. Of particular relevance here, slow fluctuations of brain activity have been shown to affect high frequency neural activity by regulating the excitability level of neural populations. Such cross-frequency-coupling can take several forms. The most frequently observed type is when the power of high frequency activity is time-locked to a specific phase of slow frequency oscillations, yielding phase-amplitude-coupling (PAC). Even when readily observed in the neural recordings, such non-linear coupling is particularly challenging to formally characterize. Typically, neuroscientists use custom band-pass filtering or Hilbert transforms with cross-frequency correlations. Here, we explicitly address current limitations and propose an alternative probabilistic signal modeling approach for which statistical inference is fast and well-posed. To statistically model PAC, we propose the use of non-linear auto-regressive models which estimate the spectral modulation of a signal conditionally to a driving signal. This conditional spectral analysis enables easy model selection and clear hypothesis-testing by using the likelihood of a given model. We demonstrate the advantage of the model-based approach on three datasets acquired in rats and in humans. We further provide novel neuroscientific insights on previously reported PAC phenomena capturing two possible mechanisms for PAC: influence of amplitude and directionality estimation.},

abstract = {Resting-state functional connectivity (FC) has become a major fMRI method to study network organization of human brains. There is recent interest in the temporal fluctuations of FC calculated using short time-windows (dynamic FC) because it could provide information inaccessible with conventional static FC that is typically calculated using the entire scan lasting several tens of minutes. Although multiple studies have revealed considerable temporal fluctuations in FC, it is still unclear whether the fluctuations of FC measured in hemodynamics reflect the dynamics of underlying neural activity. We addressed this question using simultaneous imaging of neuronal calcium and hemodynamic signals in mice, and found coordinated temporal dynamics of calcium FC and hemodynamic FC measured in the same short time windows. Moreover, we found that variation in transient neuronal coactivation patterns (CAPs) was significantly related to temporal fluctuations of sliding window FC in hemodynamics. Finally, we show that observed dynamics of FC cannot be fully accounted for by simulated data assuming stationary FC. These results provide evidence for the neuronal origin of dynamic FC and further suggest that information relevant to FC is condensed in temporally sparse events that can be extracted using a small number of time points.},

To analyze sites involved in working memory, we focused on sites at which the elevation of the broadband gamma signal depended on which letter was presented. During the encoding and maintenance periods of the task, gamma and theta power were affected, but in opposing ways. Nevertheless, cross-frequency coupling (CFC) was present during both periods, suggesting that CFC is fundamental to the task. We tested a previously proposed model according to which different items are active at different phases of the theta cycle (in different gamma cycles within the theta cycle). Consistent with this model, the theta phase of letter-induced gamma elevation during maintenance reflected the order of letter presentation. These results suggest that working memory is organized by a theta-gamma code and provide strong support for the serial representation of items held in working memory.},

This article selectively reviews psychophysical and computational studies of streaming and comprehensively reviews more recent neurophysiological studies that have provided important insights into the mechanisms of streaming. On the basis of these studies, segregation of sounds is likely to occur beginning in the auditory periphery and continuing at least to primary auditory cortex for simple cues such as pure-tone frequency but at stages as high as secondary auditory cortex for more complex cues such as periodicity pitch. Attention-dependent and perception-dependent processes are likely to take place in primary or secondary auditory cortex and may also involve higher level areas outside of auditory cortex. Topographic maps of acoustic attributes, stimulus-specific suppression, and competition between representations are among the neurophysiological mechanisms that likely contribute to streaming. A framework for future research is proposed.},

abstract = {A fundamental characteristic of spontaneous brain activity is coherent oscillations covering a wide range of frequencies. Interestingly, these temporal oscillations are highly correlated among spatially distributed cortical areas forming structured correlation patterns known as the resting state networks, although the brain is never truly at 'rest'. Here, we introduce the concept of "harmonic brain modes" - fundamental building blocks of complex spatiotemporal patterns of neural activity. We define these elementary harmonic brain modes as harmonic modes of structural connectivity; i.e. connectome harmonics, yielding fully synchronous neural activity patterns with different frequency oscillations emerging on and constraint by the particular structure of the brain. Hence, this particular definition implicitly links the hitherto poorly understood dimensions of space and time in brain dynamics and its underlying anatomy. Further we show how harmonic brain modes can explain the relationship between neurophysiological, temporal and network-level changes in the brain across different mental states; (wakefulness, sleep, anaesthesia, psychedelic). Notably, when decoded as activation of connectome harmonics, spatial and temporal characteristics of neural activity naturally emerge from the interplay between excitation and inhibition and this critical relation fits the spatial, temporal and neurophysiological changes associated with different mental states. Thus, the introduced framework of harmonic brain modes not only establishes a relation between the spatial structure of correlation patterns and temporal oscillations (linking space and time in brain dynamics), but also enables a new dimension of tools for understanding fundamental principles underlying brain dynamics in different states of consciousness.},

@article{Schalk2017,
abstract = {For decades, oscillatory brain activity has been characterized primarily by measurements of power and phase. While many studies have linked those measurements to cortical excitability, their relationship to each other and to the physiological underpinnings of excitability is unclear. The recently proposed Function-through-Biased-Oscillations (FBO) hypothesis (Schalk, 2015a, 2015b) addressed these issues by suggesting that the voltage potential at the cortical surface directly reflects the excitability of cortical populations, that this voltage is rhythmically driven away from a low resting potential (associated with depolarized cortical populations) towards positivity (associated with hyperpolarized cortical populations). This view explains how oscillatory power and phase together influence the instantaneous voltage potential that directly regulates cortical excitability. This implies that the alternative measurement of instantaneous voltage of oscillatory activity should better predict cortical excitability compared to either of the more traditional measurements of power or phase. Using electrocorticographic (ECoG) data from 28 human subjects, the results of our study confirm this prediction: compared to oscillatory power and phase, the instantaneous voltage explained 20{\%} and 31{\%} more of the variance in broadband gamma, respectively, and power and phase together did not produce better predictions than the instantaneous voltage. These results synthesize the previously separate power- and phase-based interpretations and associate oscillatory activity directly with a physiological interpretation of cortical excitability. This alternative view has implications for the interpretation of studies of oscillatory activity and for current theories of cortical information transmission.},

abstract = {There is increasing interest in understanding how the phase and amplitude of distinct neural oscillations might interact to support dynamic communication within the brain. In particular, previous work has demonstrated a coupling between the phase of low frequency oscillations and the amplitude (or power) of high frequency oscillations during certain tasks, termed phase amplitude coupling (PAC). For instance, during visual processing in humans, PAC has been reliably observed between ongoing alpha (8–13 Hz) and gamma-band ({\textgreater}40 Hz) activity. However, the application of PAC metrics to electrophysiological data can be challenging due to numerous methodological issues and lack of coherent approaches within the field. Therefore, in this article we outline the various analysis steps involved in detecting PAC, using an openly available MEG dataset from 16 participants performing an interactive visual task. Firstly, we localized gamma and alpha-band power using the Fieldtrip toolbox, and extracted time courses fromarea V1, defined using amultimodal parcelation scheme. These V1 responses were analyzed for changes in alpha-gamma PAC, using four common algorithms. Results showed an increase in alpha (7–13 Hz)–gamma (40–100 Hz) PAC in response to the visual grating stimulus, though specific patterns of coupling were somewhat dependent upon the algorithmemployed. Additionally, post-hoc analyses showed that these results were not driven by the presence of non-sinusoidal oscillations, and that trial length was sufficient to obtain reliable PAC estimates. Finally, throughout the article, methodological issues and practical guidelines for ongoing PAC research will be discussed.},

@article{Cole2017,
abstract = {Oscillations in neural activity play a critical role in neural computation and communication. There is intriguing new evidence that the nonsinusoidal features of the oscillatory waveforms may inform underlying physiological and pathophysiological characteristics. Time-domain waveform analysis approaches stand in contrast to traditional Fourier-based methods, which alter or destroy subtle waveform features. Recently, it has been shown that the waveform features of oscillatory beta (13–30 Hz) events, a prominent motor cortical oscillation, may reflect near-synchronous excitatory synaptic inputs onto cortical pyramidal neurons. Here we analyze data from invasive human primary motor cortex (M1) recordings from patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) implanted with a deep brain stimulator (DBS) to test the hypothesis that the beta waveform becomes less sharp with DBS, suggesting that M1 input synchrony may be decreased. We find that, in PD, M1 beta oscillations have sharp, asymmetric, nonsinusoidal features, specifically asymmetries in the ratio between the sharpness of the beta peaks compared with the troughs. This waveform feature is nearly perfectly correlated with beta-high gamma phase-amplitude coupling (r?0.94), a neural index previously shown to track PD-related motor deficit. Our results suggest that the pathophysiological beta generator is altered by DBS, smoothing out the beta waveform. This has implications not only for the interpretation of the physiological mechanism by which DBS reduces PD-related motor symptoms, but more broadly for our analytic toolkit in general. That is, the often-overlooked time-domain features of oscillatory waveforms may carry critical physiological information about neural processes and dynamics.},

abstract = {Spectral signal analysis constitutes one of the most important and most commonly used analytical tools for the evaluation of neurophysiological signals. It is not only the spectral parameters per se (amplitude and phase) which are of interest, but there is also a variety of measures derived from them, including important coupling measures like coherence or phase synchrony. After reviewing some of these measures in order to underline the widespread relevance of spectral analysis, this report compares the three classical spectral analysis approaches: Fourier, Hilbert and wavelet transform. Recently, there seems to be increasing acceptance of the notion that Hilbert- or wavelet-based analyses be in some way superior to Fourier-based analyses. The present article counters such views by demonstrating that the three techniques are in fact formally (i.e. mathematically) equivalent when using the class of wavelets that is typically applied in spectral analyses. Moreover, spectral amplitude serves as an example to show that Fourier, Hilbert and wavelet analysis also yield equivalent results in practical applications to neuronal signals. {\textcopyright} 2004 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Signals recorded from the brain often show rhythmic patterns at different frequencies, which are tightly coupled to the external stimuli as well as the internal state of the subject. In addition, these signals have very transient structures related to spiking or sudden onset of a stimulus, which have durations not exceeding tens of milliseconds. Further, brain signals are highly nonstationary because both behavioral state and external stimuli can change on a short time scale. It is therefore essential to study brain signals using techniques that can represent both rhythmic and transient components of the signal, something not always possible using standard signal processing techniques such as short time fourier transform, multitaper method, wavelet transform, or Hilbert transform. In this review, we describe a multiscale decomposition technique based on an over-complete dictionary called matching pursuit (MP), and show that it is able to capture both a sharp stimulus-onset transient and a sustained gamma rhythm in local field potential recorded from the primary visual cortex. We compare the performance of MP with other techniques and discuss its advantages and limitations. Data and codes for generating all time-frequency power spectra are provided.},

abstract = {Recent studies have identified broadband phenomena in the electric potentials produced by the brain. We report the finding of power-law scaling in these signals using subdural electrocorticographic recordings from the surface of human cortex. The power spectral density (PSD) of the electric potential has the power-law form P(f ) approximately Af(-chi) from 80 to 500 Hz. This scaling index, chi = 4.0+/-0.1, is conserved across subjects, area in the cortex, and local neural activity levels. The shape of the PSD does not change with increases in local cortical activity, but the amplitude, A, increases. We observe a "knee" in the spectra at f(0) approximately 75 Hz, implying the existence of a characteristic time scale tau = (2pif(0))(-1) approximately 2 - 4ms. Below f(0), we explore two-power-law forms of the PSD, and demonstrate that there are activity-related fluctuations in the amplitude of a power-law process lying beneath the alpha/beta rhythms. Finally, we illustrate through simulation how, small-scale, simplified neuronal models could lead to these power-law observations. This suggests a new paradigm of non-oscillatory "asynchronous," scale-free, changes in cortical potentials, corresponding to changes in mean population-averaged firing rate, to complement the prevalent "synchronous" rhythm-based paradigm.},

It has been argued that some cases where CFC is mathematically present may not reflect an interaction of two distinct yet functionally coupled neural sources with different frequencies. Here we provide two empirical examples from intracranial recordings where CFC can be shown to be driven by the shape of a periodic waveform rather than by a functional interaction between distinct sources. Using simulations, we also present a generalized and realistic scenario where such coupling may arise. This scenario, which we term waveform-dependent CFC, arises when sharp waveforms (e.g., cortical potentials) occur throughout parts of the data, in particular if they occur rhythmically. Since the waveforms contain both low- and high-frequency components, these components can be inherently phase-aligned as long as the waveforms are spaced with appropriate intervals. We submit that such behavior of the data, which seems to be present in various cortical signals, cannot be interpreted as reflecting functional modulation between distinct neural sources without additional evidence. In addition, we show that even low amplitude periodic potentials that cannot be readily observed or controlled for, are sufficient for significant CFC to occur.},

abstract = {Recent work argues that similar network performance can result from highly variable sets of network parameters, raising the question of whether neuromodulation can be reliable across individuals with networks with different sets of synaptic strengths and intrinsic membrane conductances. To address this question, we used the dynamic clamp to construct 2-cell reciprocally inhibitory networks from gastric mill (GM) neurons of the crab stomatogastric ganglion. When the strength of the artificial inhibitory synapses (g(syn)) and the conductance of an artificial I(h) (g(h)) were varied with the dynamic clamp, a variety of network behaviors resulted, including regions of stable alternating bursting. Maps of network output as a function of g(syn) and g(h) were constructed in normal saline and again in the presence of serotonin or oxotremorine. Both serotonin and oxotremorine depolarize and excite isolated individual GM neurons, but by different cellular mechanisms. Serotonin and oxotremorine each increased the size of the parameter regions that supported alternating bursting, and, on average, increased burst frequency. Nonetheless, in both cases some parameter sets within the sample space deviated from the mean population response and decreased in frequency. These data provide insight into why pharmacological treatments that work in most individuals can generate anomalous actions in a few individuals, and they have implications for understanding the evolution of nervous systems.},

abstract = {While there is a strong interest in meso-scale field potential recording using intracranial electroencephalography with penetrating depth electrodes (i.e. stereotactic EEG or S-EEG) in humans, the signal recorded in the white matter remains ignored. White matter is generally considered electrically neutral and often included in the reference montage. Moreover, re-referencing electrophysiological data is a critical preprocessing choice that could drastically impact signal content and consequently the results of any given analysis. In the present stereotactic electroencephalography study, we first illustrate empirically the consequences of commonly used references (subdermal, white matter, global average, local montage) on inter-electrode signal correlation. Since most of these reference montages incorporate white matter signal, we next consider the difference between signals recorded in cortical gray matter and white matter. Our results reveal that electrode contacts located in the white matter record a mixture of activity, with part arising from the volume conduction (zero time delay) of activity from nearby gray matter. Furthermore, our analysis shows that white matter signal may be correlated with distant gray matter signal. While residual passive electrical spread from nearby matter may account for this relationship, our results suggest the possibility that this long distance correlation arises from the white matter fiber tracts themselves (i.e. activity from distant gray matter traveling along axonal fibers with time lag larger than zero); yet definitive conclusions about the origin of the white matter signal would require further experimental substantiation. By characterizing the properties of signals recorded in white matter and in gray matter, this study illustrates the importance of including anatomical prior knowledge when analyzing S-EEG data.},

Recent advances reveal a spatiotemporal division of labor in cortical circuits, as exemplified in the CA1 hippocampal area. In particular, distinct GABAergic (gamma-aminobutyric acid-releasing) cell types subdivide the surface of pyramidal cells and act in discrete time windows, either on the same or on different subcellular compartments. They also interact with glutamatergic pyramidal cell inputs in a domain-specific manner and support synaptic temporal dynamics, network oscillations, selection of cell assemblies, and the implementation of brain states. The spatiotemporal specializations in cortical circuits reveal that cellular diversity and temporal dynamics coemerged during evolution, providing a basis for cognitive behavior.},

@article{Vinck2011,
abstract = {Phase-synchronization is a manifestation of interaction between neuronal groups measurable from LFP, EEG or MEG signals, however, volume conduction can cause the coherence and the phase locking value to spuriously increase. It has been shown that the imaginary component of the coherency (ImC) cannot be spuriously increased by volume-conduction of independent sources. Recently, it was proposed that the phase lag index (PLI), which estimates to what extent the phase leads and lags between signals from two sensors are nonequiprobable, improves on the ImC. Compared to ImC, PLI has the advantage of being less influenced by phase delays. However, sensitivity to volume-conduction and noise, and capacity to detect changes in phase-synchronization, is hindered by the discontinuity of the PLI, as small perturbations turn phase lags into leads and vice versa. To solve this problem, we introduce a related index, namely the weighted phase lag index (WPLI). Differently from PLI, in WPLI the contribution of the observed phase leads and lags is weighted by the magnitude of the imaginary component of the cross-spectrum. We demonstrate two advantages of the WPLI over the PLI, in terms of reduced sensitivity to additional, uncorrelated noise sources and increased statistical power to detect changes in phase-synchronization. Another factor that can affect phase-synchronization indices is sample-size bias. We show that, when directly estimated, both PLI and the magnitude of the ImC have typically positively biased estimators. To solve this problem, we develop an unbiased estimator of the squared PLI, and a debiased estimator of the squared WPLI. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {Commentary Memory and cognitive complaints are frequent among patients with epilepsy, and these indicators negatively impact quality of life. Multiple factors contribute to these cognitive deficits: time lapse since seizure onset, type, etiology and frequency of seizures, comorbid mood disorders, social isolation, and side effects of medications. The anatomical region affected by focal epilepsy is also a good predictor for specific cognitive deficits; in fact, the study of temporal lobe epilepsy has been one of the main sources of knowledge into the anatomy of memory function (1). For a long time, our main strategy to prevent cognitive decline has been to control seizures and reduce medications, hoping to prevent cognitive side effects. However, a new factor has come into play as a possible contributor to cogni-tive decline and a target for therapy: By definition, interictal epileptiform discharges (IEDs) are not associated with any noticeable clinical changes and are frequently overlooked when we interpret the EEG (1). We often use these discharges to confirm the diagnosis of epilepsy and aid in the localization of the epileptogenic zone-rarely as a surrogate for disease severity but almost never as a target for treatment. In fact, we often teach our trainees to "treat the patient, not the EEG" and to avoid overinterpreting findings; that said, the relatively benign clinical significance we attribute to IEDs may not be the case with specific cognitive deficits in patients with epilepsy. Transient cognitive effects of IEDs in cognition have been highlighted by task-and time-specific cognitive testing that co-localize to a specific cortical area. This phenomenon is known as "transitory cognitive impairment" (TCI) and has been described for decades (2), but testing it requires a high level of spike localization and reliable time locked neuropsychological testing. Ung et al. set themselves to evaluate the impact of IEDs in memory performance and understand what spatial and temporal characteristics of these IEDs affect specific memory processes. For this purpose, they tested 67 patients undergoing intracranial EEG recordings, using a controlled memory task that included a distractor for attention between encoding and recall. They independently evaluated the effect of IEDs arising from different anatomical localizations in relation to memory encoding and retrieval. The authors found cortical structures in the left temporal lobe (left inferior, middle, and superior temporal gyri and the fusiform gyrus) particularly sensitive to the presence of IED Cognitive deficits are common among epilepsy patients. In these patients, interictal epileptiform discharges, also termed spikes, are seen routinely on electroencephalography and believed to be associated with transient cognitive impairments. In this study, we investigated the effect of spikes on memory encoding and retrieval, taking into account the spatial distribution of spikes in relation to the seizure onset zone as well as anatomical regions of the brain. Sixty-seven patients with medication refractory epilepsy undergoing continuous intracranial electroencephalography monitoring engaged in a delayed free recall task to test short-term memory. In this task, subjects were asked to memorize and recall lists of common nouns. We quantified the effect of each spike on the probability of successful recall using a generalized logistic mixed model. We found that in patients with left lateralized seizure onset zones, spikes outside the seizure onset zone impacted memory encoding, whereas those within the seizure onset zone did not. In addition, spikes in the left inferior temporal gyrus, middle temporal gyrus, superior temporal gyrus, and fusiform gyrus during memory encoding reduced odds of recall by as much as 15{\%} per spike. Spikes also reduced the odds of word retrieval, an effect that was stronger with spikes outside of the seizure onset zone. These results suggest that seizure onset regions are dysfunctional at baseline, and support the idea that interictal spikes disrupt cognitive processes related to the underlying tissue.},

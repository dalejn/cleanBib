    "To goal of this notebook is to clean your `.bib` file to ensure that it only contains the full first names of references that you have cited in your paper. The full first names will then be used to query the probabilistic gender classifier, [Gender API](https://gender-api.com). The full names will be used to query for probabilistic race using the [ethnicolr package](https://ethnicolr.readthedocs.io/).\n",

    "If you intend to analyze the reference list of a published paper instead of your own manuscript in progress, search the paper on [Web of Knowledge](http://apps.webofknowledge.com/) (you will need institutional access).

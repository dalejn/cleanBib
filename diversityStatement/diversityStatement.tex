\section{Method}
\subsection{Citation Diversity Statement}

Recent work in several fields of science has identified a bias in citation practices such that papers from women and other minorities are under-cited relative to the number of such papers in the field \cite{mitchell2013gendered,dion2018gendered,caplar2017quantitative, maliniak2013gender, Dworkin2020.01.03.894378, bertolero2021racial, wang2021gendered, chatterjee2021gender, fulvio2021imbalance}. Here we sought to proactively consider choosing references that reflect the diversity of the field in thought, form of contribution, gender, and other factors. We obtained predicted gender of the first and last author of each reference by using databases that store the probability of a name being carried by a woman \cite{Dworkin2020.01.03.894378,zhou_dale_2020_3672110}. By this measure (and excluding self-citations to the first and last authors of our current paper), our references contain $A\%$ woman(first)/woman(last), $B\%$ man/woman, $C\%$ woman/man, $D\%$ man/man, and $E\%$ unknown categorization. This method is limited in that a) names, pronouns, and social media profiles used to construct the databases may not, in every case, be indicative of gender identity and b) it cannot account for intersex, non-binary, or transgender people. Second, we obtained predicted racial/ethnic category of the first and last author of each reference by databases that store the probability of a first and last name being carried by an author of color \cite{ambekar2009name, sood2018predicting}. By this measure (and excluding self-citations), our references contain $F\%$ author of color (first)/author of color(last), $G\%$ white author/author of color, $H\%$ author of color/white author, and $I\%$ white author/white author. This method is limited in that a) names, Census entries, and Wikipedia profiles used to make the predictions may not be indicative of racial/ethnic identity, and b) it cannot account for Indigenous and mixed-race authors, or those who may face differential biases due to the ambiguous racialization or ethnicization of their names. We look forward to future work that could help us to better understand how to support equitable practices in science.
